Welcome to MIMEco
==================
**MIMEco** is a Python package that explores communities metabolic interactions using multi-objective linear programming on GEnome-scale Metabolic models (GEMs).
This tool automates the inference of interaction type, interaction score and exchanged metabolites between two models in a given condition.

The concept of the methodology is described in `Lambert, A., Budinich, M., Mah√©, M., Chaffron, S., & Eveillard, D. (2024). Community metabolic modeling of host-microbiota interactions through multi-objective optimization. Iscience, 27(6). <http://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2024.110092>`_ 

You can access the source code on `github <https://github.com/Anna-cell/mimeco>`_
